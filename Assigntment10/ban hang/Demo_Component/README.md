# Demo Component - Cake Shop

This is a Node.js Express application for a cake shop with MongoDB database.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Routing Errors Fixed
- ✅ Fixed "Cannot GET /product_type.html" → Now works with `/product_type`
- ✅ Fixed "Cannot GET /about.html" → Now works with `/about`  
- ✅ Fixed "Cannot GET /contacts.html" → Now works with `/contacts`
- ✅ Fixed "Cannot GET /checkout.html" → Now works with `/checkout`

### 2. Image Display Issues Fixed
- ✅ Added proper static file serving for product images
- ✅ Fixed image paths in product display
- ✅ Created sample data with proper image references

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Setup Environment**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/demo_component
   PORT=4000
   ```

3. **Start MongoDB**
   Make sure MongoDB is running on your system

4. **Seed Database (Optional)**
   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```
   This will populate the database with sample products and product types.

5. **Start Application**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. **Access Application**
   Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:4000`

## Available Routes

- `/` - Homepage (shows products)
- `/about` - About page
- `/contacts` - Contact page  
- `/product_type` - Product types page
- `/checkout` - Checkout page

```

## What Was Fixed

1. **Routing**: Updated all navigation links to use proper Express routes instead of .html files
2. **Controllers**: Added missing controller methods for all pages
3. **Views**: Created missing partial views for product_type and checkout pages
4. **Images**: Fixed image serving by adding proper static file routes
5. **Database**: Added sample data seeding script for testing

The application should now work without any routing errors and display product images correctly.
